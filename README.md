## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `View App`

https://react-redux-songs.now.sh/

### `App Steps`
1) Set up boilerplate (index & App), and installed redux and react-redux. We are going to let Redux handle the state side of things, so made App a simple functional component.
